    <h1>Tuna Sandwich</h1>
    <img src="../photos/Tuna_Salad.jpg">
    <p><em>        A tuna sandwich is a classic go-to option for lunch or a quick meal. It typically consists of canned tuna mixed with mayonnaise, and is often seasoned with salt, pepper, and other spices. This mixture is then spread onto two slices of bread, which can be toasted or left as is. Some people like to add additional ingredients such as lettuce, tomato, or cheese to their tuna sandwich for added flavor and texture. Tuna sandwiches are easy to make and can be enjoyed on the go or packed for a lunchtime meal.    </em></p>
